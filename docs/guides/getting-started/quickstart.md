# Quickstart

A 5-minute introduction to building your first domain with Protean.

!!! note "Coming Soon"
    This guide is under construction. In the meantime, head over to
    [Compose a Domain](../compose-a-domain/index.md) for a thorough walkthrough
    of building a domain model.

## What You'll Build

A minimal domain that models a `Book` aggregate with title validation,
a `Register` command, and a command handler to process it — all running
with in-memory adapters.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.11+
- Protean installed ([Installation](./installation.md))
