# Installation

## Install Python

!!! note
    Protean supports Python 3.11 and newer, but it is recommended that that you
    use the latest version of Python.

[pyenv](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv) allows you to install and manage
multiple versions of python. Follow pyenv's
[installation](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv?tab=readme-ov-file#installation)
guide to install Python 3.11+.

There are many version managers that help you create virtual environments,
but we will quickly walk through the steps to create a virtual environment with
one bundled with Python, `venv`.

## Create a virtual environment

Create a project folder and a `.venv` folder within. Follow Python's
[venv guide](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html) to install a new
virtual environment.

```shell
$ python3 -m venv .venv
```

## Activate the environment

```shell
$ source .venv/bin/activate
```

Your shell prompt will change to show the name of the activated environment.

You can verify the Pyton version by typing ``python`` from your shell;
you should see something like
```shell
$ python --version
Python 3.11.8
```

## Install Protean

Within the activated environment, install Protean with the following command:

```shell
$ pip install protean
```

## Verifying

Use the ``protean`` CLI to verify the installation:

```shell
$ protean --version
Protean 0.13.0
```

To verify that Protean can be seen by your current installation of Python,
try importing Protean from a ``python`` shell:

```shell
$ python
>>> import protean
>>> protean.get_version()
'0.13.0'
```

That's it! You can now get a sneak peek into Protean with a quick tutorial.
