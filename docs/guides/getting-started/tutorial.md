# Tutorial

A guided, end-to-end walkthrough of building a complete application with Protean.

!!! note "Coming Soon"
    This tutorial is under construction. For now, the
    [Guides](../compose-a-domain/index.md) section covers each concept
    in depth.

## What You'll Build

A small but complete order management system that demonstrates:

- Defining aggregates, entities, and value objects
- Adding behavior with invariants and domain services
- Processing commands and handling events
- Building projections for read-optimized views
- Persisting state and running the async server

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.11+
- Protean installed ([Installation](./installation.md))
- Familiarity with the [Quickstart](./quickstart.md)
