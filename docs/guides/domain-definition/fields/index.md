# Fields

Fields are fundamental components that define the structure and behavior of
data within domain models such as Aggregates, Entities, and Value Objects.
This section provides a comprehensive guide to the various types of fields
available in Protean, detailing their attributes, options, and built-in
functionalities that help in the effective management of domain data.

Fields in Protean are designed to encapsulate data properties in domain models,
ensuring data integrity and aligning with the business domain's rules and logic.
They play a critical role in defining the schema of data containers and are
pivotal in enforcing validation, defaults, associations, and more.

Internally, fields are python descriptors that manage the attributes of
elements. They help Protean fine-tune and customize attribute access, making
it possible to define properties, manage attributes, and control data
validation.

## Field Arguments

Protean fields come with various options to model real-world scenarios effectively.
These include `required`, `default`, `choices`, and `unique`, among others, which allow for a highly customizable and robust
domain model definition.

## Types of Fields

### Simple Fields

[Simple fields](./simple-fields.md) handle basic data types like strings, integers, and dates.
They are the building blocks for defining straightforward data attributes in
models. Options like `max_length` for `String` or `max_value` and `min_value` for
numeric fields like `Integer` and `Float` allow you to specify constraints
directly in the model's definition.

### Container Fields

[Container fields](./container-fields.md) are used for data types that hold multiple values, such as
lists and dictionaries. These fields support complex structures and provide
options such as `content_type` for `List` fields to ensure type consistency
within the collection. Protean optimizes storage and retrieval operations for
these fields by leveraging database-specific features when available.

### Association Fields

[Association fields](./association-fields.md) define relationships between different domain models,
such as one-to-one, one-to-many, and many-to-many associations. These fields
help in mapping complex domain relationships and include functionalities to
manage related objects efficiently, preserving data integrity across the domain.
