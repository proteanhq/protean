# Compose a Domain

In Protean, the Domain serves as the central composition root of your application, providing a structured way to organize and manage your domain elements, configuration, and adapters.

## Domain as a Composition Root

The Domain acts as a composition root, bringing together all the essential components of your application. It provides a centralized location where all elements are registered, configured, and made available for use throughout your application. This centralization simplifies dependency management and promotes a more maintainable architecture.

## Key Responsibilities

### Element Management

The Domain maintains a registry of all domain elements, including entities, value objects, repositories, services, and other components. This registry serves as a catalog that makes these elements discoverable and accessible throughout your application.

### Configuration Storage

Your Domain stores configuration settings that define how your application behaves. These settings can include database connection parameters, feature flags, environment-specific values, and other application-wide settings. Read more at [Configuration](../configuration.md).

### Adapter Activation

The Domain manages the lifecycle of adapters, which are components that connect your application to external systems and services. This includes activating the appropriate adapters based on your configuration and ensuring they are properly initialized.

### Automatic Element Collection

Protean's Domain leverages Python decorators to automatically collect and register domain elements. By simply applying the appropriate decorator to your classes, they are automatically discovered and registered with the Domain during initialization.

```python
from protean import Domain

domain = Domain(__file__)
...

@domain.aggregage
class User:
    # Aggregate definition...
```

This declarative approach reduces boilerplate code and makes your domain model more expressive and maintainable.
