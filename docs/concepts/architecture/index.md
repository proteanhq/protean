# Architecture Patterns

The three architectural approaches Protean supports, each building on the
previous one.

- [**Domain-Driven Design**](./ddd.md) — Aggregates, repositories, and domain events.
- [**CQRS**](./cqrs.md) — Separating command and query responsibilities.
- [**Event Sourcing**](./event-sourcing.md) — Deriving state from an append-only event log.
- [**Choosing an Architecture**](./architecture-decision.md) — How to decide which approach fits your needs.
