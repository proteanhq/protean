# Concepts

The concepts section helps you understand *why* Protean works the way it
does. It covers foundational concepts, architectural patterns, design
decisions, and the internal machinery.

For factual lookup of specific options, see
[Reference](../reference/index.md).
For step-by-step instructions, see [Guides](../guides/index.md).

-   **:material-compass-outline: Philosophy & Principles**

    ---

    The convictions that guide every design decision in Protean.

    [:material-arrow-right-box: Philosophy](philosophy/index.md)

-   **:material-pillar: Foundations**

    ---

    Core DDD concepts: ubiquitous language, bounded contexts, identity,
    invariants, streams.

-   **:material-chart-timeline: Architecture Patterns**

    ---

    DDD, CQRS, and Event Sourcing as implemented in Protean.

-   **:material-toy-brick-outline: Building Blocks**

    ---

    What each domain element is, its purpose, and its key characteristics.

-   **:material-lightning-bolt-outline: Async Processing**

    ---

    The engine, subscriptions, outbox pattern, priority lanes, and stream
    categories.

-   **:material-puzzle-outline: Ports & Adapters**

    ---

    How Protean separates domain logic from infrastructure through ports
    and adapters.

    [:material-arrow-right-box: Ports & Adapters](ports-and-adapters/index.md)

-   **:material-engine-outline: Internals**

    ---

    Deep dives into the field system, shadow fields, query system, and
    event sourcing mechanics.
