**Protean** is a Clean Architecture oriented, Multi-Purpose Development Framework. Protean has been built to be customized to your needs, whether you are building a simple web app or an entire backend ecosystem for your company's offering.

.. warning:: **Protean** is currently under active development. APIs and Interfaces are to be expected to change drastically and newer releases will almost certainly be backward incompatible. If you are interested in using Protean for your project, you may want to wait for the first stable production-ready version 0.1.0. If you want to use the framework *right now*, drop us an `email <subhash@team8solutions.com>`_.

The User Guide
--------------

This part of the documentation introduces some background information about protean, then focuses on step-by-step instructions for getting the most out of Protean.

.. note:: Protean's test code is littered with usage of a certain `Dog` class. If you find that discomforting, replace `Dog` with `CuteLittlePuppyDog` everywhere.

    **Disclosure**: No real dog was harmed in the process of building this framework.
