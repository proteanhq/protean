**Protean** is a Python Framework that encourages domain driven design, providing the tools necessary to express your business logic succinctly and precisely while remaining agnostic to underlying technology.

It is a great fit for you if you are:

- Building robust, mission-critical applications for complex and uncharted domains
- Porting complicated Legacy applications onto newer technology stacks
- Creating innovative products that will adapt and evolve over long cycles

*Protean is free, open source, and always will be.*

.. warning:: **Protean** is currently under active development. APIs and Interfaces are to be expected to change drastically and newer releases will almost certainly be backward incompatible. If you are interested in using Protean for your project, you may want to wait for the first stable production-ready version 0.1.0. If you want to use the framework *right now*, drop us an `email <subhash.bhushan@gmail.com>`_.
