**Protean** Framework helps you build ever-evolving applications that can scale and adapt to growing requirements without significant refactoring.

Protean at its core is a programming model that encourages domain driven design, with tools necessary to express your business logic succinctly and precisely while remaining agnostic to the underlying technology. It also provides operational tools to build and maintain a sophisticated infrastructure that allows you to scale and distribute robust, mission-critical applications, through cutting-edge DevOps utilities.

Protean is a great fit for you if you are:

- Building robust, mission-critical applications for complex and uncharted domains
- Creating innovative products that will adapt and evolve over long cycles
- Porting complicated Legacy applications onto newer technology stacks

*Protean is free, open source, and always will be.*

.. warning:: **Protean** is currently under active development. APIs and Interfaces are to be expected to change drastically and newer releases will almost certainly be backward incompatible. If you are interested in using Protean for your project, you may want to wait for the first stable production-ready version 0.1.0. If you want to use the framework *right now*, drop us an `email <subhash.bhushan@gmail.com>`_.

Goals
-----

Protean has two broad goals in mind:

**1. Isolate Business logic from the underlying technology and closely model it after the Domain**

Developers should be able to express infrastructure-free domain logic in a clear and concise way, without worrying about underlying technology implementation. The framework should be pragmatic enough, though, and allow usage of exclusive technology features where possible for performance or aesthetics. Developers can delay critical decisions until the last possible moment and switch between technologies painlessly if and when the time does come.

**2. Support Operations and Infrastructure maintenance**

Developers should be able to deploy and scale applications in realtime on most popular IaaS platforms as well as private data centers. All infrastructure components, like databases, API frameworks, message brokers and cache, are maintained outside the application and plugged into the framework during runtime.

Key Features
------------

Protean is ready for today's diverse and multilayered software stack requirements:

- Lightweight APIs
- Non-opinionated and non-enforcing Application Code structure
- Abstract implementations for well-understood design patterns
- Expressive Domain Language for both developers as well as Business Users
- Full support for Domain-Driven Design
- Support for a variety of SQL and NoSQL Databases
- Ready to use plugins for popular API frameworks like Flask and Pyramid
- Extendable interfaces to build custom plugins
- Concrete Implementations for typical Business requirements like Authentication and Notifications
- Container support for Docker
- Kubernetes driven deployment mechanisms
- Out-of-the-box support for deploying into AWS, Azure and GCP

*Protean officially supports Python 3.7+.*
