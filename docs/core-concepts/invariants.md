# Invariants

Invariants are conditions or rules that must always hold true for an entity or a system to remain in a valid state. They are critical in ensuring the consistency and integrity of the domain model.

## Why Invariants Matter

1. **Data Integrity**: Invariants help maintain the correctness of data by enforcing rules that prevent invalid states.
2. **Business Rules**: They encapsulate essential business logic, ensuring that domain entities behave as expected.
3. **Error Prevention**: By validating invariants, you can catch potential issues early, reducing the risk of bugs and inconsistencies.

## Examples of Invariants

- A bank account's balance must never be negative.
- An order must always have at least one item.
- A user's email address must be unique within the system.

## Implementing Invariants

Invariants can be enforced in various ways, such as:

1. **Entity Methods**: Validate invariants within entity methods to ensure they are always checked when the entity's state changes.
2. **Domain Events**: Use domain events to trigger invariant checks when specific actions occur.
3. **Application Services**: Validate invariants at the application service level before performing operations.

## Best Practices

- Clearly define invariants during the design phase of your domain model.
- Write automated tests to verify that invariants are enforced correctly.
- Log violations of invariants to aid in debugging and monitoring.

By adhering to these principles, you can ensure that your system remains robust and reliable.
