# Bounded Contexts

Bounded Contexts are a core concept in Domain-Driven Design (DDD). They help define clear boundaries within a domain model, ensuring that different parts of the system remain cohesive and focused on their specific responsibilities.

## What is a Bounded Context?

A Bounded Context represents a logical boundary within a domain where a specific model is defined and consistently applied. Within this boundary:
- The meaning of terms and concepts is consistent.
- Business rules and logic are encapsulated.
- The model is isolated from other parts of the system.

## Why Use Bounded Contexts?

1. **Clarity**: They prevent ambiguity by ensuring that terms and concepts have a single, well-defined meaning within the context.
2. **Modularity**: They promote modularity by isolating different parts of the system, making it easier to understand and maintain.
3. **Scalability**: They allow teams to work independently on different contexts without stepping on each other's toes.
4. **Flexibility**: They make it easier to adapt to changes in business requirements by isolating the impact of changes.

## Examples of Bounded Contexts

- **E-commerce System**:
  - **Order Management**: Handles orders, payments, and invoices.
  - **Inventory Management**: Tracks stock levels and product availability.
  - **Customer Management**: Manages customer profiles and preferences.

- **Healthcare System**:
  - **Patient Records**: Manages patient data and medical history.
  - **Billing**: Handles invoices, payments, and insurance claims.
  - **Scheduling**: Manages appointments and resource allocation.

## How to Define Bounded Contexts

1. **Understand the Domain**: Collaborate with domain experts to identify distinct areas of responsibility.
2. **Identify Boundaries**: Look for natural separations in the domain, such as different business processes or teams.
3. **Define Models**: Create a model for each context that reflects its specific rules and terminology.
4. **Establish Communication**: Define how different contexts will interact, using techniques like domain events, APIs, or shared services.

## Best Practices

- **Avoid Overlapping Responsibilities**: Ensure that each context has a clear and distinct purpose.
- **Use Ubiquitous Language**: Within each context, use a consistent language that is shared by developers and domain experts.
- **Document Context Maps**: Create diagrams or maps to visualize the relationships and interactions between contexts.
- **Decouple Contexts**: Use techniques like anti-corruption layers to prevent one context from leaking into another.

By defining and adhering to Bounded Contexts, you can create a system that is easier to understand, maintain, and scale.
