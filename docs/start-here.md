# Start Here

Welcome to Protean! Whether you're a seasoned developer or new to the framework, this guide will help you navigate the documentation and get started on the right foot.

## Installation

Ready to dive in? The first step is to get Protean up and running on your system. The [Installation guide](./guides/getting-started/installation.md) will take you through a brief tour to setup Protean locally.

## Core Concepts

Get to know the driving principles and core ideas that shape this framework in [Philosophy](./core-concepts/philosophy.md). In [Domain Elements](./core-concepts/domain-elements/index.md) section, explore key DDD elements like Aggregates, Repositories, Events, and more, to understand the core structures of Protean.

## Building with Protean

Everything you need to know to build ambitious applications with Protean is in
the [Guides](./guides/index.md) section.

Protean supports three architectural approaches, each building on the one
before it:

- **[Domain-Driven Design](./guides/pathways/ddd.md)** — Model your domain
  with application services, repositories, and events. The simplest way to
  start.
- **[CQRS](./guides/pathways/cqrs.md)** — Separate reads from writes with
  commands, command handlers, and projections.
- **[Event Sourcing](./guides/pathways/event-sourcing.md)** — Derive state
  from event replay for full audit trails and temporal queries.

Not sure which to pick? Start with DDD — you can evolve later. See
[Choose a Path](./guides/pathways/index.md) for guidance.

Within the guides, you'll find everything from crafting rich
[domain models](./guides/compose-a-domain/index.md) to configuring
[infrastructure adapters](./adapters/index.md). Looking for best practices?
The [Patterns](./patterns/index.md) section covers common design patterns
and strategies.
