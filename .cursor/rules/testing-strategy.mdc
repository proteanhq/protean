Strategy:

- Don't use mocks in tests, unless really necessary
- Check for tests for every change, and add if necessary

Commands:

- Test All Broker Implementations: `protean test -c BROKER`: Runs generic tests marked `pytest.mark.broker` with all implementations of broker.
- Test All EventStore Implementations: `protean test -c EVENTSTORE`: Runs generic tests marked `pytest.mark.eventstore` with all implementations of eventstore.
- Test All Database Implementations `protean test -c DATABASE`: Runs generic tests marked `pytest.mark.database` with all implementations of database.
- Run core tests with Memory stub: `protean test` Basis tests with memory implementations for database, broker, cache, and event store.
- Run all possible tests with all adapter implementations: `protean test -c FULL`: Runs full test suite and calculates coverage. 

Use `--redis`, `--sqlite`, `--elasticsearch`, `--postgresql` and other markers to run specific tests against a particular technology.

Refer to src/protean/cli/test.py to understand testing possibities.
Check the markers around test classes and methods to know what option to pass.
