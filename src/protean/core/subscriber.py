        This method can be overridden in subclasses to provide custom error handling
        for exceptions that occur during message processing. It allows subscribers to
        recover from errors, log additional information, or perform cleanup operations.

        When an exception occurs in a subscriber's __call__ method:
        1. The exception is caught in Engine.handle_broker_message
        2. Details are logged with traceback information
        3. This handle_error method is called with the exception and original message
        4. Processing continues with the next message (the engine does not shut down)

        If this method raises an exception itself, that exception is also caught and logged,
        but not propagated further.

        Args:
            exc (Exception): The exception that was raised during message handling
            message (dict): The original message being processed when the exception occurred

        Returns:
            None

        Note:
            - The default implementation does nothing, allowing processing to continue
            - Subclasses can override this method to implement custom error handling strategies
            - This method is called from a try/except block, so exceptions raised here won't crash the engine
