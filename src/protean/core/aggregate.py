    """This is the base class for Domain Aggregates.

    Aggregates are fundamental, coarse-grained building blocks of a domain model. They are
    conceptual wholes - they enclose all behaviors and data of a distinct domain concept.
    Aggregates are often composed of one or more Aggregate Elements (Entities and Value Objests),
    that work together to codify a concept.

    This class provides helper methods to custom define aggregate attributes, and query attribute
    names during runtime.

    Basic Usage::

        @domain.aggregate
        class Dog:
            id = field.Integer(identifier=True)
            name = field.String(required=True, max_length=50)
            age = field.Integer(default=5)
            owner = field.String(required=True, max_length=15)

    During persistence, the model associated with this entity is retrieved dynamically from
        the repository factory. A model object is usually pre-initialized with a live DB connection.
